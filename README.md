# SVM

Comparison of different linear SVM classifiers on a 2D projection of the iris dataset. We only consider the first 2 features of this dataset:
  1. Sepal length
  2. Sepal width

SVC with Gaussian RBF has been used in this peice of code. It is a  non-linear kernel model which has flexible non-linear decision boundaries with shapes that depend on its parameters.

##SVC with RBF Kernel. 
Sepal length along x-axis and width along y-axis.
